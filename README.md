# gps_ublox

Driver for [u-blox](https://www.u-blox.com/) GPS modules

The driver provides a set of input and output interfaces that allows to abstract
the protocol enabled in each port. A small command line interface is provided
to easily enable/disable ports and protocols.

While it is part of the Rock project, this driver is pure CMake and C++ code. It can
be reused on non-Rock environments provided that you also install its dependencies.
